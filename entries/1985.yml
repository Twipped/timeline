description: For the most part I was a really happy kid, inspite of growing up in an abusive home. I didn't have any super strong feelings of gender wrongness, but I did often find myself wishing I could dress the way the girls at church did. Most of what I wore was what my mom made me wear, and I don't remember having any clothing that I liked.
